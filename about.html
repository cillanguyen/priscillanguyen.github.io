          Xin chao! I am Priscilla!
        </h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently a 3rd year intending to study Informatics with a
          concentration in Data Science. I really enjoy working with programing
          codes and discovering new ways to make technology more accessible.
          With that I soon will be working with the UW IT department to provide
          accessibility through our main platform such as Canvas, Google and
          Zoom. I have had many projects regarding to the career route that
          I'm trying to do to and its all linked below.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my spare time, I like to explore Seattle and find new cafes
          around. Since Seattle is known for their coffee chain. I have find
          a variety of cafes specializing in different style of coffee.
          Many of these places interior is very aestheically pleasing.
          Other then that, I enjoy taking pictures on film and digital. I have
          a personal photography account where I post architect buildings from
          the places I have been too.
        </p>
        <p>
          While taking this course, I hope to learn the key skills in succeeding
          in my new job and learning about the backend of a website. Making
          websites always, amazes me everytime, and maybe I can be amaze
          everytime I come to class. So lets have fun and make sites!

            Google Flight and rename it and analysis it using the same
            methods in the previous analysis.

          I'm currently a 3rd year studying Geography with a concentration in
          Data Science also known as GIS with a minor in Informatics. I'm currently employeed at the University of Washington Information
          Technology department as a IT Accessibility Researcher. I have a passion
          for data and information technology. I enjoy using data to solve real
          world problems and finding issues that we wouldn't be able to do with
          just observing the world. Other then my passion for these two things, I enjoy
          taking <a href="https://archtorgraphy.framer.website/">archphotography</a>. I have
          linked my photography website. I also enjoying discovering new cafes and
